# Vectorized Search, RAG Implementation and Document Intelligence with Invoice Analysis

## Objective

The primary objective of this exercise was to implement a vectorized search system using Azure AI, with a specific focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) related search capabilities. This project demonstrates the practical application of AI in information retrieval and generation tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **Azure AI**: Utilized for its advanced search and indexing capabilities.
- **Azure AI Document Intelligence**: Used for processing invoice images and extracting relevant information.
- **OpenAI API**: Employed for generating responses based on the retrieved information.
- **Azure Storage**: Used for storing data in JSON format within containers.

## Methodology

1. Data Storage: Resume data stored in JSON format within Azure Storage containers for easy access and manipulation.
2. Indexing: Configuring indexers to map data from storage containers to the search index, enabling efficient retrieval.
3. Vectorized Search: Implementation of vectorized searches for nuanced and context-aware query matching.
4. Response Generation: Utilizing LLM to respond to queries based on the vectorized searched documents.
5. Image Upload: Facilitating the upload of invoice images to the system.
6. Document Processing: Utilizing Azure AI Document Intelligence to analyze the uploaded images.
7. Data Extraction: Identifying and extracting relevant information from the processed documents.

## Getting Started

- Used free credits from Azure Free trial.
- Create an account and recharge for 3 to 4 dollars for OpenAI API.
