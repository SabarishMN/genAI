# Vectorized Search and RAG Implementation

## Objective

The primary objective of this exercise was to implement a vectorized search system using Azure AI, with a specific focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) related search capabilities. This project demonstrates the practical application of AI in information retrieval and generation tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **Azure AI**: Utilized for its advanced search and indexing capabilities.
- **OpenAI API**: Employed for generating responses based on the retrieved information.
- **Azure Storage**: Used for storing data in JSON format within containers.

## Methodology

1. Data Storage: Resume data stored in JSON format within Azure Storage containers for easy access and manipulation.
2. Indexing: Configuring indexers to map data from storage containers to the search index, enabling efficient retrieval.
3. Vectorized Search: Implementation of vectorized searches for nuanced and context-aware query matching.
4. Response Generation: Utilizing LLM to respond to queries based on the vectorized searched documents.

## Application

- Efficient searching through resume data using advanced vectorized search techniques.
- Generation of human-like responses using the OpenAI API, augmented with retrieved information.

## Outcomes and Learnings

- Gained hands-on experience with Azure AI's search and indexing capabilities.
- Developed a deeper understanding of vectorized search techniques and their advantages over traditional search methods.
- Learned to integrate multiple AI services (Azure AI and OpenAI) to create a more powerful and versatile system.
- Understood the practical implementation of RAG and its potential in enhancing AI-generated responses with retrieved information.
- Acquired skills in working with JSON data formats and Azure Storage containers.
- Realized the potential of AI in transforming document processing and information retrieval tasks.

## Getting Started

- Used free credits from Azure Free trial.
- Create an account and recharge for 3 to 4 dollars for OpenAI API.
